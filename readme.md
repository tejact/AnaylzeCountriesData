# Analyze Countries Data

The dataset youâ€™ll be using is a combination of two data sources from World Bank. For each country of the world, two indicators (or measures) are included: the number of internet users per 100 during 2013, and the adult literacy rate in 2013, given as the number of literate adults out of 100. Consult the Project Resources for more information on data collection.The underlying question that might fuel an initial look into this data could be: is there a relationship between internet usage and adult literacy?
